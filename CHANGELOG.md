and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.1] - 2025-08-07

- Made `Plane` `Copy`

## [0.6.0] - 2025-08-02

- Added `Plane::points_dist_std_dev`
- `Plane::fit_to_point_cloud_wo_outliers` now takes a std dev threshold as parameter

## [0.5.0] - 2025-07-11

- Renamed `reject_3_sigma_dist` to `reject_n_sigma_dist` to allow more flexibility in outlier rejection.
- Added field `weight` to `PointCloudPoint` to allow weighted point cloud processing.
- Added `point_to_plane_lls_weighted` which is the only transform estimator that respects the weights of the points.
- Removed `reject_outliers_plane_dist`
- Added `Plane::fit_to_point_cloud_wo_outliers`

## [0.4.0] - 2025-07-05

- Added trait `ToPointCloud` to make ICP easy to use with point clouds loaded from various sources.
- Added modelz integration
- `estimate_transform` has slightly changed to allow `ToPointCloud` in parameters

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-02

- Renamed `is_small_squared_distance_error` to `same_squared_distance_error`
- `estimate_transform` now returns the final alignment error together with the transform
- Principal Component Analysis now returns the Eigenvalues together with principal axes
- ICP now accepts a filter to filter out points to be considered for alignment
  - Two predefined filters are provided: `accept_all` and `above_planes`

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-26

- Some small cleanups
- point_to_plane_lls::estimate_isometry now returns an Isometry3 instead of a IsometryMatrix3
- rerun visualization works

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-21

- Implementation of various variations of ICP which can be combined modularly
